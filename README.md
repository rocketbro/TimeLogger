## Description
TimeLogger is a command-line application designed for simple task tracking. It provides a minimalistic approach to logging tasks, avoiding the complexities of other task-tracking applications. I created TimeLogger to streamline my task logging process without distractions.

### Future Features
While TimeLogger is currently basic in functionality, future updates may include features such as task categorization, removing tasks from log file, and improved user interface.
